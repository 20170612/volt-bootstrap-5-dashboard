![Volt - PBootstrap 5 Dashboard](https://themesberg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/products/volt-bootstrap-5-dashboard/volt-bootstrap-5-dashboard-preview.jpg "Volt - PBootstrap 5 Dashboard")

Volt is a premium Bootstrap 5 Admin Dashboard featuring over 800 premium components, 10 advanced plugins and 20 dashboard pages.

**800+ Bootstrap 5 components**

Volt is based on the latest version of Bootstrap 5 meaning that all of the components like buttons, alerts, navigation bars and so on use the new Bootstrap 5 Sass variables and markup.

**Vanilla JS**

Because Bootstrap 5 no longer request jQuery as a dependency we also decided to create Volt as a Vanilla JS Admin Dashboard. Every library and scripts don't include and don't require jQuery at all.

**20 Dashboard Pages**

We created 20 dashboard pages including messaging, calendar, map, user settings, login in, register and many more.

**10 Advanced Plugins**

We have customized 10 advanced plugins both in terms of styling and we also wrote extra Javascript code to extend the features and functionality. Every plugin is completely open source and won't require another license purchase.

**Complete Documentation**

Each component, plugin and the general workflow is well documented. Check out the [online documentation for Volt Pro](https://themesberg.com/docs/volt-bootstrap-5-dashboard/getting-started/quick-start/).

## Workflow

This product is built using the following widely used technologies:

- Most popular CSS Framework Bootstrap
- Productive workflow tool Gulp

## Demo

-   [Live Preview](https://demo.themesberg.com/volt-pro/)
-   [Product Page](https://themesberg.com/product/admin-dashboard/volt-premium-bootstrap-5-dashboard)

## Quick start

1. Purchase from [Themesberg](https://themesberg.com/product/admin-dashboard/volt-premium-bootstrap-5-dashboard)
2. Download the project's zip
3. Make sure you have Node locally installed.
4. Download Gulp Command Line Interface to be able to use gulp in your Terminal.

```
npm install gulp-cli -g
```

5. After installing Gulp, run npm install in the main `volt/` folder to download all the project dependencies. You'll find them in the `node_modules/` folder.

```
npm install
```

6. Run gulp in the `volt/` folder to serve the project files using BrowserSync. Running gulp will compile the theme and open `/index.html` in your main browser.

```
gulp
```

While the gulp command is running, files in the `assets/scss/`, `assets/js/` and `components/` folders will be monitored for changes. Files from the `assets/scss/` folder will generate injected CSS.

Hit `CTRL+C` to terminate the gulp command. This will stop the local server from running.

## Theme without Sass, Gulp or Npm

If you'd like to get a version of our theme without Sass, Gulp or Npm, we've got you covered. Run the following command:

```
gulp build:dev
```

This will generate a folder `html&css` which will have unminified CSS, Html and Javascript.

## Minified version

If you'd like to compile the code and get a minified version of the HTML and CSS just run the following Gulp command:

```
gulp build:dist
```

This will generate a folder `dist` which will have minified CSS, Html and Javascript.
